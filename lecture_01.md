### Assessment

- Two lab assignments
- Graded on two written reports
- Exams: understanding of lectures and reading assigmnets will be assessed in two exams

### Why deep learning?
- Computer science mad great advances in tasks that are:
    - Described by formal mathematical rules
    - Relatively simple for computers
    - Often difficult for humans
- AI had been less effective in tasks that are:
    - Hard/impossible to describe using formal mathematical rules
    - But easy for humans to perform
        - Intuitive or automatic
- Simulation of neural computation

### Deep learning tasks

- Object recognition
- Autonomous driving
- Playing games (chess / go)
- Natural language processing
- Simulation of brains


### Deep learning approach

- Learn from experience (machine learning)
    - No formal rules of transformations
    - No 'knowledge base'
    - No logical inference
- Process inputs through a hierarchy of concepts
    - Each concept defined by its relationship to simpler concepts
    - So, build complicated concepts out of simpler concepts

### Representations & features

- Machine learning performance depends on the *representation* of the case to be classified.
    - What information is the computer given about the situation
- Each piece of input information is known as a *feature*
    - The same feature can be represented in different formats
        - Often easy to convert between formats
- The chosen format strongly affects the difficulty of the task

### Representations in deep networks
- Useful features may need to be transformed or extracted first
- So deep networks have multiple representations
    - Each build from previous representation
- Transform features to a different format before learning their links to the output
- Extract complex features from simpler features
- Essentially, multiple steps in a program
- Each layer can be seen as the state of the input after applying a certain computation.
